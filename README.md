# GNN-Geo

Code for "GNN-Geo: A Graph Neural Network-based Fine-grained IP geolocation Framework", which has just been accepted by IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, and can be cited throw an early-access version. Formal Code and hashed data sample will be released no later than May 5th, after my family's vacation.
